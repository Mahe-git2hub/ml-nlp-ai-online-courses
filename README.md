# ML NLP AI Online Courses
All the coursera courses I did

For Individual courses check their folder's readme.md

### Course Setup
- For each course have data download scripts which download and create folder structure in case files not already present
- View the readme.md inside each course for course specific setup

### Working Principles
- Results, both intermediate and final should be reproducible, never check-in results into source control
